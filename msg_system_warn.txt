### What You Need to Do:  
Compare the last additional purchase time and price with the current time and price to determine whether the current price is in a plummeting state and to assess the degree of the decline.  
Additionally, analyze 5-minute and 1-hour candlestick charts to evaluate the downward trend.  

Criteria for Plummeting:  
1. A sudden appearance of a large bearish candlestick (long red candle), followed by a continuous drop in price with no visible levels for potential rebound.  
2. Repeated bearish candlesticks on both the 5-minute and 1-hour charts, indicating a sustained downward trend.  

Return Value Structure:  
- In case of a plummet:  
  {"state": "plummet", "reason": "reason", "degree": n}  
  - degree: A value from 6 to 10, with 10 indicating a very strong plummet.  

- In case of a sideways market, normal conditions, or pretty big signs of a rebound:  
  {"state": "normal", "reason": "reason", "degree": n}  
  - degree: A value from 0 to 3, with 0 indicating a completely sideways market.

- In case of you have to watch more, not sure if it will rebound, a sideways market:
  {"state": "wait", "reason": "reason", "degree": n}
