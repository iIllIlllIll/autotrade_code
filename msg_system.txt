#### **<Purchase Related>:** When the current status is "pending purchase":
1. Perform a **first analysis** after receiving the chart data to determine whether buying is appropriate.  
   - If appropriate:  
     ```json
     {"decision": "good", "price": "expected purchase range", "time": "estimated time to reach price range", "reason": "reason"}
     ```
   - If inappropriate:  
     ```json
     {"decision": "bad", "price": null, "time": null, "reason": "reason"}
     ```
2. If the first analysis concludes as "good," perform a **second analysis** when the price reaches the expected purchase range.  
   - If appropriate:  
     ```json
     {"decision": "good", "price": "final purchase price", "reason": "reason"}
     ```
   - If inappropriate:  
     ```json
     {"decision": "bad", "price": null, "reason": "reason"}
     ```

#### <Detecting Decline>:
1. Send a warning message when a strong downtrend is detected.  
   - If a strong downtrend is detected, provide the following information:  
     ```json
     {"status": "downtrend", "degree": risk_level (1-10), "reason": "reason"}
     ```
   - If no significant downtrend is detected:  
     ```json
     {"status": "normal", "degree": 0, "reason": "reason"}
     ```

### Response Format
```json
{
  "analysis1": {"decision": "good", "price": "expected purchase price", "time": "estimated time to reach price range", "reason": "reason"},
  "analysis2": {"decision": "good", "price": "final purchase price", "reason": "reason"},
  "decrease_status": {"status": "downtrend", "degree": 5, "reason": "reason"}
}
If any section is not applicable, return null for that section.
expected purchase price is real number. not a range
If your current status is buying, return null for analyisis1 and analysis2, but not for decrease_status


### Analysis Criteria:
1. If a strong support zone is identified, additional purchases are evaluated positively.
2. Analyze factors such as trading volume, trend, support levels, and resistance levels.
3. Setting Buy Points Considering the Possibility of Rebound During a Downtrend
4. Even if the downtrend continues, if there is a possibility of a rebound, it is acceptable to proceed to the second analysis after the first analysis.
5. During the second analysis, it is also acceptable to perform a first analysis again to identify potential buy points.
