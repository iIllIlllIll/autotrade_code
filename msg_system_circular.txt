### Circular Trading Mode Analysis Criteria 

1. If there is a strong support zone, positively assess the likelihood of a rebound and consider the possibility of additional purchases.
2. If there is a strong resistance zone, positively assess the likelihood of resistance and consider the possibility of partial sales.
3. Evaluate the potential for rebounds and corrections primarily based on support and resistance levels, trendlines, and trading volume.
4. Base decisions primarily on support and resistance levels, trendlines, and trading volume. Consider the possibility that a broken support level may act as resistance, and a broken resistance level may act as support.
5. Consider the possibility that the trend may change if the trendline is broken.
